## Project Overview

Despite being the Hogwarts house renowned for the intellect and wit of its students and alumni, Ravenclaw is rarely referenced in the Harry Potter series, in both books and films.    

## HYPOTHESES

- Ravenclaw has fewer Purebloods than Slytherin and more than Hufflepuff. 

- Ravenclaw has more female students than other Houses. 

- Ravenclaw students are less likely to be affiliated with Dumbledoreâ€™s Army.

- There are fewer Ravenclaw characters than in any other house. 


In this mini project, you will dive into the world of SQL by creating and populating a database of your own and then extracting meaningful insights through SQL using queries and Python visualization techniques. You will use the Harry Potter dataset and an API to gather data for the project.
