### By Raynard Flores, Rosemary Medina, Gian F. Villafane, Maya Wilson-Fernandez, Alex Lopez, Dylan Sedeno

## Project Overview

Despite being the Hogwarts house renowned for the intellect and wit of its students and alumni, Ravenclaw is rarely referenced in the Harry Potter series, in both books and films.    

## HYPOTHESES

- Ravenclaw has fewer Purebloods than Slytherin and more than Hufflepuff. 

- Ravenclaw has more female students than other Houses. 

- Ravenclaw students are less likely to be affiliated with Dumbledoreâ€™s Army.

- There are fewer Ravenclaw characters than in any other house.
